# 🚀 Databricks 14-Day AI Challenge

This repository documents my complete learning journey through the **Databricks 14-Day AI Challenge**, organized by **Codebasics** and **Indian Data Club** in collaboration with **Databricks**.

Over 14 days, I built an **end-to-end Lakehouse + Analytics + Machine Learning workflow** using Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, SQL, MLflow, and Spark ML — with consistent hands-on implementation and real-world use cases.

---

## 📌 Challenge Objectives
- Build strong foundations in Databricks & Apache Spark
- Design scalable data engineering pipelines
- Apply Delta Lake for reliability and performance
- Perform SQL analytics & dashboarding
- Prepare data for Machine Learning
- Train, track, and compare ML models using MLflow
