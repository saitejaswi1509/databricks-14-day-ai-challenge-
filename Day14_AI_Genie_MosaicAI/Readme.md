### 📘 Day 14 | Databricks 14-Day AI Challenge | AI-Powered Analytics: Genie & Mosaic AI

This notebook focuses on how AI can be directly integrated into analytics workflows using Databricks Genie and Mosaic AI.

The goal of Day 14 was to move beyond traditional SQL and dashboards and explore AI-assisted analysis, where insights are generated using natural language and generative AI models.

**🎯 Objective**

- Use natural language to query data and generate insights

- Explore Databricks’ AI and ML capabilities

- Build a simple NLP task using a pretrained model

- Track AI workflows using MLflow

- Generate AI-powered, business-ready insights

**📘 What I Learned**

**🔹 Databricks Genie (Natural Language → SQL)**

Learned how Genie converts plain English business questions into SQL queries and visual insights, enabling faster and more accessible analytics without manually writing SQL.

**🔹 Mosaic AI Capabilities**

Explored how Databricks brings together experiment tracking, model management, foundation models, and serving to build and govern AI solutions directly on the Lakehouse.

**🔹 Generative AI Integration**

Understood how pretrained language models can be used for NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and how GenAI fits into real-world analytics platforms.

**🔹 AI-Assisted Analysis**

Learned how AI can summarize trends, highlight key drivers, and explain results in natural language, helping analysts focus more on decision-making than query writing.
